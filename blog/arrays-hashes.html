        <h2>Arrays vs Hashes</h2>
        <h6>Feburary, 14th 2016</h6>
        <p>
          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          An array are: ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.<br><br>

          Lets break this down a little bit... So what this means this that an array is a collection or &quot;list&quot; of an object(string,integer,etc...) these objects are ordered using and integer-indexing, starting at 0. So the first value will be indexed at 0 the second 1, third 2 etc...<br><br>

          <code>array_name = [0, &quot;one&quot;, 2, &quot;three&quot;]</code><br><br>

          <h3>Hashes</h3>
          Hashes are: a collection of unique keys and their values.<br><br>

          These are really similar to arrays, but lets first break down what the line above means. So a hash is a collection or &quot;list&quot; of keys, now these keys are very similar to the integer-index that arrays use, but for keys we can define them as anything, such as a string or integer. Then the values can be any object just like in arrays.<br><br>

          <code>hash_name = { key1: &quot;value1&quot;, key2: &quot;value 2&quot;, 3: 3}</code><br><br>

          In this line of code the hash name comes first and then we set it equal to a hash with keys of , key1: key2:, 3: each key is assigned a value the values above are &quot;value1&quot;, &quot;value 2&quot; and 3.<br><br>

          In previous versions of Ruby you will see hashes defined as follows:<br><br>
          <code>hash_name = { :key1 => &quot;value1&quot;, :key2 => &quot;value 2&quot;, :3 => 3}</code><br><br>

          In recent updates they have created the short hand which I used originally, they both do the exact same thing, just one is easier to type.<br><br>

          <h3>VS</h3>

          Both arrays and hashes come in handy. Where I am at with my knowledge of ruby, beginner, I would not say that one is better than the other. Figuring out which one to use just comes down to what you need it for. If you wanted a list of friends that you had, you could use an array.<br><br>

          <code>friends_array=[Joe, Dylan, Jon, Sammy, Kate]</code><br><br>


          Lets say you wanted to store specific details of a friend and you needed to retrieve those details with a set key, you would use a hash.<br><br>

          <code>joes_hash = { haircolor: &quot;brown&quot;, eyecolor: &quot;blue&quot;, trustworthy:&quot;no&quot; }</code><br><br>

          If you wanted to see if Joe was trust worthy you would put:<br><br>
          <code>joes_hash[trustworthy:]</code><br><br>
          this would give you <code>&quot;no&quot;</code>  <br>
          Boom know you know not to trust Joe and it was real easy to look up.
