How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was great working with a pair on the wire frame, we were able to work back and forth and come to a much better designed site overall. We were able to talk about why we did things out own way and then put it all together.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing was extremely helpful, we were able to figure out where to put things and how to div them out. I know that it will become even more helpful with going back with css.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We came to the conclusion that something between fully mocked and drawn was the best option and easy to read. We had seperate boxes outlined to really show when things ended such as the nav and body.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  It was kind of a refresher for the me, but we looked at most of the new HTML5 elements that get rid of having div class's. I found these much easier to read.
