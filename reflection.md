##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  -I'm not truly sure if I learned too much more about them, there placing around an element is something I learned in earlier challenges. I did find that margin is extremely helpful when it comes to moving things around on the page.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  -Positioning is something that still confuses me a bit. I know how they each work to some extent, It's getting things to position realative to thier parent div that I think I'm stuck on.
##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  -Text design is the easiest, as well as anything that resides in it own line on the page, as soon as you need to have a picture and side bar on eaither side of text, things got sticky for me. I eneded up working through it though.
##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  -The biggest thing I learned was how to make an image round. By using "border-radius: _px;"!
