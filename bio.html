    <section>
      My name is Sean M Norton. I was born and raised in Ohio.
      I spent 2014 in San Francisco and am currently living in Chicago, where I am attending Dev BootCamp.
      I (partially) went to school for photography and still love taking photos to this day.
      I am super into off beat graphic novels and will take all recommendations in my inbox!
      Also, I Love To Camelcase Everything, Though I Often Have To restrain Myself.
